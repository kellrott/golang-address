# golang-address

Normalizer / Parser for physical US addresses.

# Disclaimer

you probably should use [gopostal](https://github.com/openvenues/gopostal) instead of this.

# Motivation

Is your inherited legacy system getting you down?

Did you finally decide to throw up a quick Go API to wrap around some awful mess of Oracle stored procedures and un-touchable PHP scripts, only to find that "StreetName", "StreetType", "StreetDirection", etc. are individual fields in an overpriced database which doesn't have a proper GIS plugin?

Worried that you'll have to deal with splitting and normalizing addresses for all of your forms without creating separate fields for each item?

Me too.

So here you go.
